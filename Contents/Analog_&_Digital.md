## Digital:
Digital refers to a type of signal or data that is discrete and binary, consisting of two possible states: ON or OFF, HIGH or LOW, 1 or 0. In the context of electronics, digital signals are used for devices like switches, relays, or logic circuits, where the state can be either fully ON or fully OFF.

- **Example**: A push-button switch on an Arduino can be used as a digital input. When pressed, the button sends a HIGH (1) signal to the board, and when released, it sends a LOW (0) signal.

## Analog:
Analog refers to a type of signal or data that is continuous and can take on any value within a range. In electronics, analog signals are used for components like sensors that measure varying physical quantities, such as temperature, light, or sound.

- **Example**: A light-dependent resistor (LDR) connected to an Arduino can send varying voltage levels (analog input) based on the intensity of light. The Arduino converts this varying voltage into a number between 0 and 1023, representing the light level.

### Key Differences:
- **Digital**: Limited to two states (1 or 0).
- **Analog**: Can represent a wide range of values, typically from 0 to a maximum defined by the system (e.g., 0 to 1023 in Arduino's analog inputs).
