## Microcontroller:
A microcontroller is a compact integrated circuit designed to govern a specific operation in an embedded system. It typically includes a CPU, memory (RAM, ROM, or Flash), and input/output peripherals all on a single chip. Microcontrollers are used in devices that need real-time control and automation.

**Example:**
- **Arduino Uno**: Based on the ATmega328P microcontroller.
- **Applications**: Washing machines, remote controls, embedded systems in vehicles.

## Microprocessor:
A microprocessor is the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer that performs general-purpose processing. It lacks built-in memory or input/output peripherals and is used in systems where higher processing power is required, typically with external components like RAM, ROM, and I/O ports.

**Example:**
- **Intel Core i7**: A high-performance microprocessor.
- **Applications**: Personal computers, laptops, and servers.

## Key Differences:
- **Integration**: Microcontrollers integrate CPU, memory, and peripherals on one chip; microprocessors require external components.
- **Application**: Microcontrollers are used for specific control tasks, while microprocessors are used for complex processing tasks.
