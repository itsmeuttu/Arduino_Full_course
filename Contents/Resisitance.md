## Resistance

**Resistance** is the opposition to the flow of electric current in a material, measured in ohms (Î©). It determines how much a material resists the movement of electrons.


## Resistor

A **Resistor** is a component used in electrical circuits to limit or regulate the flow of current. It is specifically designed to introduce a known amount of resistance into the circuit.
