## Ohm's Law

Ohm's Law states that the current (I) passing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage (V) across the two points, provided the temperature remains constant. The law is represented by the formula:

$$
V = IR
$$


Where:
-  V  is the voltage (in volts),
-  I  is the current (in amperes),
-  R  is the resistance (in ohms).
