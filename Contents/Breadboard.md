## Breadboard

A **breadboard** is a device used to build and test electronic circuits without soldering. It features a grid of interconnected holes that allow components like resistors, capacitors, and ICs to be inserted and connected using jumper wires. The connections are temporary, making it ideal for prototyping and experimenting with circuit designs.

### Key Features:
- **Power Rails**: Long strips along the sides for distributing power (typically marked with + and -).
- **Terminal Strips**: The main area where components are inserted and connected across horizontal or vertical rows.
- **Reusability**: Components can be easily inserted, removed, or repositioned.
