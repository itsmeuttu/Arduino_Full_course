## Resistance in Series:
When resistors are connected in series, the total or equivalent resistance is the sum of the individual resistances. This is because the current must pass through each resistor sequentially, adding to the total resistance.

**Formula:**
$$
R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \dots
$$

**Example:**
If three resistors of 4 Ω, 6 Ω, and 8 Ω are connected in series, the total resistance is:
$$
R_{\text{total}} = 4 \ \Omega + 6 \ \Omega + 8 \ \Omega = 18 \ \Omega
$$

## Resistance in Parallel:
When resistors are connected in parallel, the total resistance is less than the smallest individual resistor. In parallel, the voltage across each resistor is the same, but the total current is divided among the resistors.

**Formula:**
$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \dots
$$

**Example:**
If three resistors of 4 Ω, 6 Ω, and 12 Ω are connected in parallel, the total resistance is:
$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{6 + 4 + 2}{24} = \frac{12}{24} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

$$
R_{\text{total}} = 2 \ \Omega
$$
