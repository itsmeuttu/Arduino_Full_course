## Input and Output on Arduino Boards:

#### **Input:**
Arduino boards can receive various types of input from sensors, switches, or external signals. Inputs are read by the board and processed by the microcontroller to make decisions or control outputs.

- **Digital Inputs**: Can read the state of switches, buttons, or digital sensors (HIGH/LOW, 1/0). Examples include push buttons or motion sensors.
- **Analog Inputs**: Measure varying signals like light intensity or temperature. These inputs are connected to the analog pins (A0-A5 on Arduino Uno) and can read a range of values, typically from 0 to 1023.

**Example Input Devices:**
- **Sensors**: Temperature sensors, light-dependent resistors (LDR), potentiometers.

#### **Output:**
Arduino boards can control various output devices like LEDs, motors, or displays based on the processed input or programmed conditions.

- **Digital Outputs**: Control devices in ON/OFF states. For example, turning an LED on or off.
- **PWM Outputs**: Provide Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) for controlling devices like motors or dimming LEDs. PWM outputs simulate an analog output by rapidly switching the digital pin on and off at different duty cycles.

**Example Output Devices:**
- **Actuators**: LEDs, motors, buzzers, LCD screens.

Arduino boards allow the use of both digital and analog signals for interaction with the physical world, making them versatile in controlling various components in embedded systems and robotics projects.
