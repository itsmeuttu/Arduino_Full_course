## Bit:
A **bit** is the smallest unit of data in a computer system, representing a single binary value of either 0 or 1. It is the fundamental building block for all data in digital systems, including memory and communication.

- **Value**: 0 or 1 (binary).

## Byte:
A **byte** consists of 8 bits and is the standard unit of data used to represent information like a character, a small integer, or a color value in computers. Most modern systems are organized around bytes for memory and storage.

- **Value**: Can represent 256 different values (from 00000000 to 11111111 in binary, or 0 to 255 in decimal).

## Relationship:
- **1 byte** = 8 bits
- **Example**: The letter "A" in ASCII is represented by the byte 01000001 (binary).
