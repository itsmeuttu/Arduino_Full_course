An Arduino board is an open-source microcontroller platform used for building electronics projects. It features a simple, user-friendly interface that allows users to program the board to control physical devices like lights, motors, sensors, and more. The board is based on an ATmega microcontroller (e.g., ATmega328 for Arduino Uno) and can be programmed using the Arduino IDE, which supports C/C++-based coding.

### Key Features:
- **Digital and Analog Pins**: The board has multiple digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins for interfacing with sensors, LEDs, and other components.
- **Power Supply**: Arduino boards can be powered via USB, external adapters, or batteries.
- **USB Interface**: For communication between the board and a computer for programming and data transfer.

Popular boards include the Arduino Uno, Mega, and Nano, making it a versatile tool for beginners and professionals in robotics, automation, and IoT projects.
